;; Hello..
;;
;; This is a short tutorial on recursive programming
;; using a very small programming language based losely
;; on the Scheme programming language.
;;
;; Scheme itself is a dialect of LISP. If you enjoy this
;; tutorial, Clojure is a good modern LISP to learn.
;;
;; OK, let's get going!
;;
;; The prev/next buttons above navigate through the
;; tutorial.  Over to the right is the "REPL" - if you
;; type an expression and hit enter it will (R)ead it,
;; (E)valuate it, (P)rint the result, and (L)oop - i.e.
;; prompt you for another expression. This pane is a
;; editor window which we'll use later on in the
;; tutorial.
;;
;; Hit 'next'...
