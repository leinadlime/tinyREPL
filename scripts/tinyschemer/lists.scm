;; More complex data structures are made by forming
;; lists.

;; Lists are delimted with brackets and items are
;; seperate with spaces.

;; Try entering this at the REPL:
;;    '(1 2 3 4)

;; Make sure to include the single--quote character
;; at the start. This is important - it will be
;; clear why after the next tutorial...

;; Lists can contain different types:
;;    '(1 "Hello" #t 99.9)

;; Lists can contain other lists:
;;    '("Foo" (1 2 3) (#t "Bar"))
