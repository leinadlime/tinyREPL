; We have a few basic value types to
; play with: Stings, numbers and booleans.

; Stings are written with double-quotes,
; like this:
;      "Foo bar!"

; Numbers are written in decimal, e.g:
;      2.718

; True and false are written as #t and #f.

; If you type a basic value at the REPL it
; will print it back at you. Try it out..
